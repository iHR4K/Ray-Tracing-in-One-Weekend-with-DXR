# Ray-Tracing-in-One-Weekend-with-DXR
Simple implementation of well-known [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

Inspired with [Ray Tracing In Vulkan](https://github.com/GPSnoopy/RayTracingInVulkan) (Main loop of the Shader generation, Random functions DoF)

It's based on Microsoft's example, if you are already familiar with their code you can easily follow this code [Microsoft's DXR Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples)

The code is simple as it can be, please don't hate me for bad code style or something :)
